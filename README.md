# PromisePay

## Initial Product Goal

Enable individuals and organizations to secure commitments by combining financial incentives with a decentralized platform that encourages accountability and minimizes trust barriers.

## Project Overview

PromisePay is designed to enhance the reliability of commitments by leveraging security deposits and rewards. The platform not only manages promises but also motivates individuals to fulfill them through a structured, transparent process.

This project consists of 5 main components:

### WorldID Integration

Users can log in using WorldID, maintaining their anonymity while ensuring security through KYC verification. This integration prevents Sybil attacks, with every participation verified by WorldIDâ€™s zero-knowledge proof.

### Creating and Managing Promises

Users can create a promise by setting a deposit and reward amount, along with specific completion criteria and deadlines. By paying a deposit, users demonstrate their commitment. If the promise is not fulfilled, the deposit is forfeited, while successful completion results in a reward distribution.

### Verification Mechanism

Promise fulfillment is verified through multiple methods, including NFC, dynamic QR codes, authorized checkers, specific Wi-Fi connections, and mutual check-ins. User credibility scores are maintained and verified via the EAS contract, ensuring a reliable system.

### Reward and Penalty Distribution

Upon verification, the system automatically handles the distribution of rewards and penalties. Participants who fulfill their promises receive rewards, while those who don't forfeit their deposits.

### Use Case Flexibility

PromisePay is versatile, supporting a variety of scenarios including social commitments, educational goals, and crypto event participation. The platform allows for dynamic interaction, making it applicable across personal, professional, and community-focused contexts.

- **Social Life:** Manage commitments like gathering attendance, personal tasks, and friend encouragement.
- **Education and Training:** Ensure course attendance and learning goal completion with deposits and rewards.
- **Crypto Events:** Facilitate event participation with deposit-based registration and rewards, ensuring attendance and engagement.

## Development Pipeline

### Bounty Pools (Under Construction)

Businesses and DAOs will be able to post public bounties for talents to engage with, addressing specific challenges or contributing to project development.

### Payment Layer (Under Construction)

PromisePay is working on integrating a robust payment layer that will streamline transactions and facilitate smooth interactions between users and the platform.
